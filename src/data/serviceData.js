      "Purchasing flight tickets and confirming your flight booking is the key aspect of planning a trip. Now whether you are travelling for business or on leisure, you cannot make an itinerary until you have first and foremost booked your flights. Procuring an air ticket is a mandatory first step once your travel plans are confirmed. It feels as though half the job is done the moment you secure confirmed flight ticket booking in your hand. The entire activity of searching air connectivity between two cities, checking the schedule of the flight and zeroing in on one that's most convenient to you can feel like a lot of work especially if you are in a hurry to book your flights.",
